# Third-party source excerpts

`web/pinned-sources.json` and `cases/mhc-mega/pinned-sources.json` contain short, line-numbered excerpts used to explain the pinned implementations below. These excerpts remain attributed to their upstream projects and licenses; each Case records the exact source file and line range.

The reported performance and correctness values in `case.json` come from those projects' pull request discussions and are identified as author reports. They are not measurements by this repository.

## HTML scene workflow provenance

The kern runtime / vLLM integration lesson includes attributed excerpts from
[pegainfer-project/kern](https://github.com/pegainfer-project/kern) at commit
`83c3f62be263da5f1e482fe90872a29bc4800b77`, under its
[Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/pegainfer-project/kern/blob/83c3f62be263da5f1e482fe90872a29bc4800b77/LICENSE).
Each excerpt preserves its upstream file, real line numbers, blob SHA and
fixed commit link in `cases/kern-runtime/source-map.json`. The lesson's
diagrams and JavaScript grouping visualization are original teaching
adaptations; upstream measured results are labeled `reported`. No compiled
GPU kernels or model weights are bundled. The separate systems language
`kern-project/kern` is linked only to disambiguate the user's original URL.

The self-paced scene workflow was informed by HeyGen HyperFrames at commit
`d0b551d0330d4d2cd932348a911b5457ed1ed3c8` (Apache-2.0, Copyright 2026 HeyGen,
Inc.) and BBuf AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS at commit
`c592955044e896edd20890468c9bdbbe30ab0be6`. The scene reader, packet validator,
and browser QA scripts are original implementations adapted for self-paced HTML.
No upstream video runtime, BBuf code, fonts, logos, narration, or branded assets
are bundled. The inspected BBuf snapshot did not provide a root license;
its methods are attributed rather than its implementation being copied.
Pinned source links and migration decisions are recorded in
[docs/visual-tooling.md](docs/visual-tooling.md).

## HTML layout reference provenance

The optional [html-ppt-reference skill](skills/formats/html/html-ppt-reference/SKILL.md)
adapts six single-page layout styles from
[lewislulu/html-ppt-skill](https://github.com/lewislulu/html-ppt-skill/tree/fd1629067909ff55b36b905476de4e5f26062a1f),

Copyright (c) 2026 lewis <sudolewis@gmail.com>.
The [MIT license](skills/formats/html/html-ppt-reference/LICENSE) is preserved.
[Source records](skills/formats/html/html-ppt-reference/references/upstream.json)
identify the original paths, blobs, content hashes and adaptations.
The local examples replace demo content and page wrappers, add system fonts
and responsive styles, and use static local resources.
